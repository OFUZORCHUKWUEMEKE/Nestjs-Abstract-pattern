## Nest js Abstract Pattern

The abstract repository pattern is a design approach commonly used in software development to separate the data access logic from the rest of the application. This pattern promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability of code. When applied to the NestJS framework, which is a popular Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable applications, the abstract repository pattern can be a powerful tool.

In NestJS, the abstract repository pattern can be implemented using services and interfaces. 

In this article, we will be going through the process of creating an abstract repository pattern using Postgres and TypeORM

By using the abstract repository pattern in NestJS, you achieve a clear separation of concerns between the data access layer and the business logic layer. This enhances the maintainability and testability of your application, allowing you to switch out underlying data storage implementations with minimal impact on the rest of the codebase.
